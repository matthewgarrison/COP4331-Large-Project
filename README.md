# Queue & A

Queue & A allows students to ask the professor questions during a lecture (especially during classes with extremely large lectures or hybrid classes that have streamed lectures). The goal is to allow students to ask questions without stopping the professor mid-lecture, so the professor can answer any questions when they feel itâ€™s most appropriate. Additionally, this will be useful for any students who do not feel comfortable asking questions in a large class.
